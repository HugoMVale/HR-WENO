# HR-WENO

## Description

This code is a Fortran implementation of selected high-resolution [weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WENO_methods) schemes for solving [hyperbolic conservation equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_partial_differential_equation).

These routines have been sucessfully use to discretize the growth term of particle
[population balance equations (PBE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_balance_equation) with one and two internal coodinates.

The numerical methods are described in detail by [Shu (1997)](/Shu-WENO-notes.pdf).

## How to use the code

An example will be added soon.
