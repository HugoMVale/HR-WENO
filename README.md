# Description

This code is a Fortran 90 implementation of selected high-resolution [WENO (weighted essentially non-oscillatory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WENO_methods) 
schemes for solving hyperbolic conservation equations.

The numerical methods are described in detail by [Shu (1997)](\Shu-WENO-notes.pdf).

# How to use the code

An example will be added soon.
